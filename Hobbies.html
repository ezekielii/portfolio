            <p class="card-text">Since I was little I really enjoyed playing basektball, and I still do now they I am older. I found the passion of playing basektball when I was 5, my cousin looking to play in college, while my other cousin was playing in highschool. I was surrounded by it which I think it was made me love it till this day. I played my first organized basketball in 8th grade and I loved it my team was good and I played a big part in that team. That summer I wanted to become better and I practiced the whole summer becoming the player I am now. Now playing on the Lane Tech basektball team I am hoping to spend the next 4 years on this team and in the basketball enviorment I love so much. </p>

            <p class="card-text">I was 5 when I got my first gaming systmem it was the xbox 360, and I was able to play it only on weekends. It was the only thing I found fun for a while because that was the year I started kindergarten at a brand new school and I hated being away from my mom and dad. But on those weekends my dad played with me on the xbox and it was always a fun time. I later when I was older got my first game console just for myself and thats when I really started exploring the wolrd of gaming. I played for countless hours even on school days, and it gave me a way to communicate with my friends since this was during online school. Gaming will always be a thing I love.  </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Chess</h5>
            <p class="card-text"> I started playing chess when I really young, I first learned the basics of chess when I was 2. My grandpa loved chess and I used to play with him all the time, he taught me a lot. I particpated in my first test competition when I was 7 and did awful, it made me really demotivated to play chess and I didn't do no other offical chess contest until I was 10. In those 3 years chess really wasn't my focus and I was more focused on video games and other things but my mom really conviced me to start playing again because of how much I loved it when I was younger. Doing another contest really scared me and once again I did horrible. Although I was really sad about it chess taught me that at that time I would always underpeform under pressure, so now that is something I work on ever since. I don't play chess as often anymore but I never wanna forget the things it taught me. </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Cubing</h5>
            <p class="card-text"> I had lunch after my 1st period at my middle school and that is where I would learn to solve my first cube. It was 7th grade year and this one boy in my grade always had a cube on him and he called himself a "speed cuber." I had no idea what it was and how he even solved it not even to mention how fast. I wanted to learn, he was my friend and in my lunch class and he would do it at his lunch table with a few other friends, I asked him to teach me and so I did. It took him a week to teach me everyday at lunch for those 50 minutes, I got a hang of it and soon I was solving it cosinently with no mistakes. I begged my mom to buy me a cube of my own and I started to get faster and faster and soon got faster times solving the cube then the people he taught before me. At the end of 7th grade I had stopped cubing but it is still something I take pride in doing.  </p>
